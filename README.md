E_Commerce_BackEnd

Description

For this challenge we were tasked with building the back end or an e-commerce website.  This challenge was a little intimidating but not nearly as bad as I thought so far.  It is once again a work in progress as it isn't as functional as it should be.  This is another challenge that motivates me to do better as it mirrors real world applications and problems we'll certainly run into in the developper's world.  I was helped throughout the process by my instructor Leif Hetland, the TA Fred Kamm, my classmates, and my tutor, Erik Hoversten.
